## How to Play Minesweeper ([Link](https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Minesweeper))
<br>

### Learning Minesweeper Mechanics
<br>

#### `1 - Understand the principles behind Minesweeper.`

- Each Minesweeper game starts out with a grid of unmarked squares. 
- After clicking one of these squares, some of the squares will disappear, some will remain blank, and some will have numbers on them. 
- It's your job to use the numbers to figure out which of the blank squares have mines and which are safe to click.
Minesweeper is similar to a Sudoku puzzle in that your success is largely contingent on being able to eliminate possible answers until only one answer remains.

`2 - Use the mouse's left and right buttons.`

- The mouse is the only tool that you'll need to play Minesweeper.
- The left mouse button is used to click squares that don't contain mines, while the right mouse button is used to flag squares that contain mines.
- On higher difficulties, you'll need to mark squares that you suspect contain mines until you can verify that they do contain mines.

`3 - Don't worry about your first click.`
- The first square that you click will never have a mine beneath it;[1] clicking a square will clear off some of the board while numbering other squares.

`4 - Know what the numbers mean. 
- A number on a square refers to the number of mines that are currently touching that square. 
  - For example, if there are two squares touching each other and one of the squares has "1" on it, you know that the square next to it has a mine beneath it.
